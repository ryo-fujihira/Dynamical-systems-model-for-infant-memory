# Dynamical-systems-model-for-infant-memory

The python codes for simulations impremented in 'Dynamical systems model of embodied memory in early human infancy' 

model_1.py　is the code for reproducing the main experiment by four variables model. 

model_1_no_train.py is the code for reproducing the familiarization/reactivation control group by four variables model.

model_2.py　is the code for reproducing the main experiment by five variables model. 

model_2_no_train.py is the code for reproducing the familiarization/reactivation control group by five variables model.

ratio_calculation.py was utilized when calculating retention ratios in each simulation. 

asymmetric_bifurcation_plot.py was used to make Figure 12, and minimum_duration.py was used to make Figure 18.
